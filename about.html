        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Robert Adoga</strong>, a Frontend Developer with over 3 years of experience building
          scalable, responsive, and user-focused web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like
          <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>. My passion lies in transforming ideas into
          intuitive digital products that combine clean design with seamless performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked across agile teams and startups, contributing to SaaS platforms and client-driven
          projects. My experience includes designing and implementing reusable UI components, integrating
          secure RESTful APIs, and maintaining production-ready applications using technologies like
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Firebase</strong>.
          Accessibility, maintainability, and user experience are at the core of my development approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical work, I am a strong advocate for clean code practices, design consistency, and
          continuous learning. I enjoy mentoring junior developers, collaborating cross-functionally with
          designers and backend engineers, and finding creative solutions that improve usability.
          Outside of coding, I love photography, exploring new cities, and diving into sci-fi movies.

        <p>
          Dear Future Robert,
        </p>
        <p>
          Never stop improving. Every project, challenge, and late night debugging session contributes to
          the developer you are becoming. Keep refining your craft, stay humble, and continue learning from
          every experience, both successes and failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep exploring the boundaries of frontend engineering, but remember the essence of great software
          lies in human experience. Stb ay curious, stay consistent, and keep empowering others along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          With focus and passion,<br>
          Robert
